Random Forest is a **divide-and-conquer** method useful for data classification and 
regression. Random Forest is an **ensemble learning** method - generate several classifiers and 
aggregate their results into one at final - built on **decision trees** (figure.1 [1]). In the other 
words, a model generated by random forest combines several weaker learners (classifiers) into 
a stronger learner at final. The following figure.2 [1] is an example of the above statements.

[Figure.1] A simple example demonstrates decision trees. There is a variable with conditions to classify two dimension data, people who want to play and not to play ball games.
