## Content

The following are the fields introduced in the book.

* [Modeling](modeling.md) : Modeling is the event or description representation and is also taking time as the unit. In the book, we use several examples to introduce how to solve the modeling on Python, R, and matlab (partial). The book focuses on how to construct the ODE, solve it, and calculate it by coding.
  * [1st order differential equation](first-order-ode.md) : $$\frac{dx}{dt} = 3e^{-t}$$, and initial x(0) = 0
  * [2nd order differential equation](second-order-ode.md) :　
    - $$\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} +５\frac{dx}{dt}-4x(t) = sin(10t)$$, and initial x(0) = 0 and x'(0) = 0
    - $$(3x-1)\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}-(3x+2)\frac{dy}{dt}-(6x-8)y = 0$$, and initial y(0) = 2, y'(0) = 3
