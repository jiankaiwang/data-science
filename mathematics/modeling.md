### First Order ODE
---

* solve 1st order differential equation : $$\frac{dx}{dt} = 3e^{-t}$$, and initial x(0) = 0

### Second Order ODE
---

* solve 2nd order differential equation in Matlab :　$$\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} +５\frac{dx}{dt}-4x(t) = sin(10t)$$, and initial x(0) = 0 and x'(0) = 0

* solve 2nd order differential equation in Python : $$(3x-1)\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}-(3x+2)\frac{dy}{dt}-(6x-8)y = 0$$, and initial y(0) = 2, y'(0) = 3
